Test Your Application
	Run Your Electron App: In your terminal, run:
	--->npm start
	This should open a window displaying your PWA.

Create an Installable Package
	Install electron-packager: To package your app, you can use electron-packager. Install it globally or as a dev dependency.
	---> npm install electron-packager --save-dev

Package Your App: Run the following command to package your application. You can customize the name and platform as needed.

	--->npx electron-packager . MyPWA --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist --overwrite
Replace MyPWA with your desired application name.
Adjust --platform and --arch as needed (win32, linux, darwin for Mac, etc.).

Find the Executable: After running the command, your packaged app will be in the dist folder. You'll find an executable file (e.g., MyPWA.exe for Windows) that can be distributed.

Additional Considerations
Icons and Metadata:
	You can also add application icons and customize the package metadata by specifying additional options in electron-packager.

Auto-Updating:
	Consider implementing auto-updating functionality if needed using libraries like electron-updater.
